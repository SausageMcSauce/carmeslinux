# carmeslinux

Some Linux distro thingy in progress. This is still incomplete and will be updated frequently

# Installing

To use CarmesLinux, get the Debian Buster ISO (the only supported distro by CarmesLinux), available on the Debian Website.

During installation when the options for software come up, I highly reccommended you tick the 'Standard system utilities' option for a CarmesLinux machine. For now, have that Debian install console-only.

Then, install git and clone this repository. Then run the Bash script (use `sudo bash`)
